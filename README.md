# Advanced Todo List App

Welcome to the README file of the Advanced Todo List Application. This React app is designed to provide you with a fully functional and feature-rich todo list experience. It not only includes all the basic todo functionality but also incorporates advanced features such as todo text editing and marking tasks as important. With additional technical enhancements like DOM manipulation, browser routing, local storage, and keyboard event listeners, this app aims to provide a seamless and efficient user experience.

## Features

- Create, Read, Update, and Delete todo items.
- Edit the text of existing todo items for better task management.
- Mark todo items as important to prioritize tasks.
- DOM manipulation using the Document Object Model (DOM) and JSDOM.
- Browser routing/navigation for a smoother user experience.
- Local storage implementation to support offline usage and data persistence.
- Keyboard event listeners for quick todo item creation and editing.

## Technical Details

The Advanced Todo List Application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The app takes advantage of several technical components to provide its advanced functionality:

- **Document Object Model (DOM) and JSDOM:** The app utilizes the DOM for dynamically rendering and updating todo items in the user interface. JSDOM is employed for server-side rendering of the DOM, enhancing performance.

- **Browser Routing/Navigation:** The use of browser routing allows for seamless navigation between different views of the app without the need for full page reloads.

- **Local Storage:** Local storage is employed to store todo items locally on the user's device. This ensures data persistence and enables offline usage of the app.

- **Keyboard Event Listeners:** Keyboard event listeners are integrated to enhance user experience. They enable rapid creation and editing of todo items directly from the keyboard.
